	 <h1> I'm the owner of <br>MiLLYJaWN Studio LLC<br> and Leader Artist. </h1>
	<p> I've been making art all my life and I've always been passionate about it.
		There's something about taking a black sheet of paper and putting life into that I've always found comforting 
		and relaxing. 
	  </p>
	  <br>
    <p>.   Art has been an outlet for me all my life. It's allowed me to connect and bond with people when I felt like that would be impossible. 
	    I was initially a shy person growing up. People gravitated to me though because of my art and creativity. I was able to use my passion
	    as a gateway to communicating and friendship and life in general. Many of the friends I've made over the years feel the same way. 
	    <br><br>
	    
	    My dream has always been to make my passion my career and use it to give back to those around me. Art has given so much to me 
	    and I feel it's only right to use it to show others it can do the same for them. 
	    <br><br>
	    I made up in my mind to build a company up into a multimedia studio that brings money and positivity into the city that raised me.
	    Philadelphia aka Philly can seem rough sometimes but like myself, it's a beautiful place that just needs love and care put into it. 
	    <br>

“THERE ARE PROGRAMS IN THIS CITY LIKE ASAP AND MURAL ARTS THAT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH THROUGHOUT MY ADOLESCENT LIFE.
	    THEY HELPED NURTURE MY TALENTS AND PASSIONS. I WANT TO BUILD UP SOMETHING THAT DOES THE SAME FOR OTHERS. I KNOW IT MEANT A LOT IN ME
	    FINDING WHO I WAS AS A PERSON AND WHAT DIRECTION I WANTED TO GO IN LIFE.
	    I WANT TO BUILD AN EMPIRE THAT CREATES WHOLESOME CONTENT AND ALSO CULTIVATES DREAMS. TO EDUCATE, EMPOWER, AND ENHANCE. 
	    THAT’S THE GOAL OF THE SPACE I’M CREATING. THAT’S THE MISSION OF MILLYJAWN STUDIO AND THE PURPOSE OF MY ART JOURNEY.”</p>
